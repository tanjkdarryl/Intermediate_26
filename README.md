## TOMMO (A gentle, accessible mental health check-in platform for everyday self-awareness.)

## Overview
> TOMMO is a Streamlit-powered mental health web application designed to help users reflect on their emotional well-being. Unlike traditional clinical tools, TOMMO offers warmth, anonymity, and interactivity through three core self-assessment features:
> PHQ-9 Depression Screener
> Facial Emotion Recognition
> Suicide Risk Text Analysis (NLP-based)
> The app does not diagnose or store data â€” it simply listens, reflects, and encourages.

## Features

2. Detects emotional states like sadness, anger, and neutrality.
3. Processes locally; no data is stored or uploaded.

# Feature 3 - Suicide Text Detection
1. Accepts written input from the user.
2. An NLP model evaluates for suicide risk indicators in the text.
